# HUB
This app tries to improve the customer’s overall experience on Android platform.

Let me walk through you through my app. The homepage will serve you with latest Events and hot restaurants. One can book tickets for the Events or can even book table at a restaurant. The app will learn your activities and will further give suggestions for the attire or any related product from the Walmart store that you can buy directly online. 
For instance like if I have booked a table at a fancy restaurant where there is a particular dress code(say formals), Hub will suggest you popular suits, pants, skirts, etc that’s available in Walmart. Hub will not only give suggestions related to Walmart products but will try to relate to other services too. Like if I like the walmart product and I want to  purchase it from the nearest store, it will also recommend me to book a cab.

We understand most of the service and we know how they work. But now its time for the services to understand us so that they can serve us better. This is what my app tries to aim.
